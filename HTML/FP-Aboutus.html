                &nbsp; &nbsp;Our founder, Aleph, knows what a hassle it is to cite sources properly. 
                This is why he designed a program that could format the entire syntax 
                for citing sources using just the URL. As a separate service, our 
                software quickly and easily checks your papers for bad and awkward grammar. 
            </p>

                &nbsp; &nbsp;After creating a simple version during college in 2021, Aleph spent more 
                time polishing and refining his program into what you see today. Aleph would
                go on to add a plagurism checker and even a grammar checker. Now, Aleph 
                would like to share the same convience without all the hassle.
